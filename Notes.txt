================  PLEASE ADD ANY OTHER RELEVANT QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR THE DEV GUY ABOVE THIS LINE =====================

According to our developer, his Spring-boot java code has a web interface. 

We are therefore going to need to configure the following in the security group attached to the 
ec2 instance (Redis Server) running the code:
 - open port 8080 for tomcat (for Spring-boot Java) 
 - allow traffic from the acceptable sources (Dev guy to confirm)
 - allow the port to send traffic to the desired destination (Dev guy to confirm)

 - open port 6379 for Redis to communicate from
 - allow traffic from the our ElastiCache cluster
 - allow the port to send traffic to all destination within our VPC

 - open port 22 for SSH connections to the instance 
 - allow traffic from the all sources (Dev guy to confirm)
 - allow the port to send traffic to all destination (Dev guy to confirm)





================  PLEASE ADD ANY OTHER RELEVANT ITEMS WE MAY NEED TO INCLUDE IN OUR DELIVERABLE ABOVE THIS LINE  ===================
